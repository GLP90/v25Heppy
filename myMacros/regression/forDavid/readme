check inputs and outputs in each macro to match yours.

Line 47 in treeForRegression.C set the outfile name

Line 1817 in treeForRegression.h set the infile name

1) .L treeForRegression_Wln.C
	treeForRegression_Wln e
	e.Loop()

It will create a tree per jet containing all the relevant info for the training. Here matching is done to quark.

Line 257 in TMVARegressionWln_softlept_19.C set the input file of trees for training

2) .x  TMVARegressionWln_softlept_19.C

It will perform the training and it will create the output directory for weights 


3) python writeRegZll.py

It will apply weights created in step 2) and it will compute the H mass with these correction ( w and w/o FSR additional correction)
